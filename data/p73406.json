Or venture further afield and try a family hike.</li>\n<li><b>Be a role model!</b> Kids <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12966-020-00973-0\">learn from the adults</a> in their lives. Do your best to fit some physical activity into your day, and talk to your children about why you make time to be physically active.</li>\n<li><b>Think outside the box.</b> Not everyone wants to play a sport, and that is OK! Activities such as dance, circus or theatre may work for kids who enjoy creative activities. Organisations like Scouts or Guides include physical activity without a focus on competition.</li>\n<li><b>Physical activity does not have to be structured.</b> Spending time playing at the park, playground or the beach can be great ways to get outdoors and get moving.</li>\n<li><b>Make habits.</b> Once you have found physical activities that your kid enjoys, try and find ways to fit them into the family routine.</li>\n<li><b>Don’t aim for perfect.</b> You don’t need to develop the ideal physical activity routine for your child overnight. It will likely take time to figure out which activities your child enjoys the most and how to fit them into your life. And remember – any physical activity is always better than none (that 5-minute walk to the shops counts!).</li>\n</ol></div></div></body></html></div><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/73411/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/73411/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/73411/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/73411/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/73411/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/73411/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/73411/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/73411/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/73411/d8bf74cf7ef95cf7521ca4312408cf5c53ddbb11.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Gymnastics clubs that are explicitly inclusive of young people with disability help families participate in this activity.
