For instance, a visual artist might be a designer, a children’s book illustrator and a puppet-maker at various points in their career. In the performing arts, a stage manager might also have been an actor, or later become a director.</p><p class=\"left\">Women artists frequently hold multiple employments throughout their careers. This pattern, formerly implicit, reveals how women tend to maintain more diverse role profiles over their working lives, suggestive of a widespread tendency towards females holding ‘portfolio careers’.</p><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/109090/varieties/64w.webp 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/109090/varieties/160w.webp 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/109090/varieties/375w.webp 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/109090/varieties/768w.webp 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/109090/varieties/960w.webp 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/109090/varieties/1280w.webp 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/109090/varieties/1440w.webp 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/109090/varieties/1920w.webp 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/109090/gendered-labour-4.webp\" alt=\"A modern gallery space with paintings on the wall and people standing around\"   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>‘Know My Name’ is a gender equity initiative of the National Gallery of Australia, celebrating all women artists.
