This work showed that female mice and sheep who ingested a high glucose, high energy diet were more likely to birth male offspring. In contrast, where mothers ingested a low glucose, low energy diet they were more likely to have female offspring.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">We don’t exactly know why diet has this effect</span>, although it may be because male offspring are slightly larger in the uterus and so require more energy output from the mother – it may be a reflection of the mother’s ability to invest in the pregnancy.</p><p>While we believe the situation is likely to be the same in humans, this information is particularly relevant for the agricultural industry – for example, beef farmers who want more males, or dairy farmers who need more females.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">I’ve also looked at the impact of temperature on the </span><span class=\"bold italics\">in utero</span><span class=\"bold\"> (in the uterus) development of piglets.</span> When a female pig is exposed to ambient temperatures above 28°C, her placenta is less effective at moving nutrients to the growing offspring.
