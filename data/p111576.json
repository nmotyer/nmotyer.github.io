Women continue to navigate sexual harassment without support because they fear losing their jobs</h2><p>Having paid employment and a regular source of income is paramount to migrant women’s residence and safety in Australia.</p><p>A major reason some women did not formally disclose their experiences was they were concerned about the impact it would have on their employment.</p><p>Instead, migrant and refugee women were more likely to informally share their experiences with other women (friends or colleagues), but not to pursue formal complaints.</p><p>Temporary visa holders have the additional burden of navigating the migration system if they need to leave their employment.

The silence around sexual harassment offers impunity </h2><p>Migrant and refugee women overwhelmingly told us that silence around harassment is also a major discouragement from  reporting it.</p><p>If they did complain the most likely outcome was that the perpetrator or the complainant would be moved around within the organisation. </p><p>No formal actions were taken, there were no ‘real’ consequences and there was limited formal recognition that the perpetrator’s behaviour was unacceptable in the workplace.</p><p>One overarching concern was that workplace responses lack transparency.
