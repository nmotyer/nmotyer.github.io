In other words, replace some of the bowling balls with ping-pong balls.</p><p class=\"left\">The current state-of-the-art dark matter detectors are made from heavy xenon atoms. Adding a small amount of hydrogen (the lightest element) to these detectors would be enough to do the trick.</p><p class=\"left\">This is an idea that <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"http://hep.ucsb.edu/people/hugh/research/\" target=\"_self\">the HydroX group</a></span> is pursuing – a proposed upgrade to the LUX-ZEPLIN dark matter experiment located at the <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"https://sanfordlab.org/\" target=\"_self\">Sanford Underground Research Facility</a></span> in the USA.</p><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/94539/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Sciences &amp; Technology</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/finding-dark-matter-in-the-dark?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Finding dark matter in the dark <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><p>Second, we could look for a different signal that is easier to detect. If a dark matter particle hits an atomic nucleus, it could occasionally cause the atom to shake off an electron – the so-called ‘<span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.096015\" target=\"_self\">Migdal effect</a></span>’.</p><p class=\"left\">This ejected electron can be seen even if the recoil of the nucleus itself is undetectable. The most sensitive searches for light dark matter currently use this technique, using <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.035032\" target=\"_self\">theoretical predictions</a></span> calculated by researchers at the University of Melbourne.</p><p class=\"left\">Our team <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.L091902\" target=\"_self\">has recently demonstrated</a></span> that combining these two techniques could be especially effective. It would enable the detection of dark matter 200-times lighter than a hydrogen atom.</p><p class=\"left\">A third way to hunt for light dark matter is to look for ‘boosted’ dark matter – meaning dark matter that is much more energetic than usual.</p><p class=\"left\">The dark matter in our galaxy moves around relatively slowly (about one million kilometres per hour – which is actually very slow for an elementary particle). However, a small amount of the dark matter is likely to be moving much faster.</p><p class=\"left\">There are lots of ways we might get some higher-energy, high-speed dark matter, but the most compelling is ‘cosmic ray dark matter’.</p><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/109909/varieties/64w.webp 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/109909/varieties/160w.webp 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/109909/varieties/375w.webp 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/109909/varieties/768w.webp 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/109909/varieties/960w.webp 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/109909/varieties/1280w.webp 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/109909/varieties/1440w.webp 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/109909/varieties/1920w.webp 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/109909/b76538a63c211d6cba6a3cfc780b3b8033e276e2aa274505adcf57c9f250.webp\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Cosmic ray particles travel through the galaxy at close to the speed light.
