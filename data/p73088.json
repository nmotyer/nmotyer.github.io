The deep connection to country and genuine care for the landscape that Yolŋu and other First Nations People have is profound and needs to be supported and protected at all costs.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Our country has over 2000 of the most incredible native bee species which are amazing, beautiful and in need of our help.</span> Many people don’t realise that European honeybees, aside from being important crop pollinators and commercial honey producers, are actually feral in the Australian environment.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Bee hotels are more like nurseries, where females can safely lay their eggs</span>. Constructing a bee hotel is a small and easy thing that can have huge benefits for local conservation of native bees, particularly in urban settings where flowers are abundant, but nesting habitat like bare ground and native trees is very limited.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/73173/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Environment</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/i-ll-never-forget-the-first-iceberg-we-saw?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>“I’ll never forget the first iceberg we saw” <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p><span class=\"bold\">So far, I have contributed to building 37 bee hotels</span> and I run a <a href=\"https://nativebeehotels.com/\" target=\"_self\">website</a> with tips on making optimal bee hotels. It’s such a simple and easy DIY project that can have a big benefit for our biodiversity. My top three tips for building a successful bee hotel are placement, materials and design.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Placement:</span> Bees need morning sun, and plenty of food resources like flowers nearby they can pollinate.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Materials: </span>Native hardwood like Eucalyptus, or hollow/pithy stemmed materials like bamboo are best for cavity nesting bees like <a href=\"https://www.aussiebee.com.au/leafcutter_bee.html\" target=\"_self\">leaf cutter bees</a> or <a href=\"https://www.aussiebee.com.au/masked-bees.html\" target=\"_self\">masked bees</a>, while sand and clay mixtures are the best materials for building earth blocks which provide habitat for ground nesting bees like <a href=\"https://www.aussiebee.com.au/blue-banded-bee-information.html\" target=\"_self\">blue banded bees</a>.</p><p>Be careful if buying a pre-made bee hotel as some overseas materials are chemically treated or have been fumigated at customs, which can be detrimental to native bees.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Design:</span> When drilling the holes, you want to use varying sizes between three to 10 millimetres in diameter. The bees will lay an egg in each cell, and you want to make as many cells as possible that fit into the cavity – that’s why a deep hollow is so important. Holes larger than 10 millimetres aren’t recommended because there’s not many native bees that are that large, especially in Melbourne.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/73093/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/73093/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/73093/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/73093/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/73093/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/73093/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/73093/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/73093/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/73093/760d962d11703f7cf5b84988808a939150fef9cb.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Clancy Lester presenting on his bee hotel project at the University of Melbourne Heritage Society 2023 Luncheon.

My dad is also learning a lot about bees now. Once everyone starts to learn about bees, they always seem to want to know more.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">My favourite bee is the </span><span class=\"bold italics\">Xylocopa</span><span class=\"bold\">, otherwise known as the </span><a href=\"https://www.aussiebee.com.au/xylocopa.html\" target=\"_self\" class=\"bold\">Carpenter bee</a>. They live for years and years, while some bees only live for a matter of weeks. They also have one of the furthest flying ranges of any bees, and they are much better fliers than other species. They essentially fly until they age and their wings start to degrade.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0033/73599/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Environment</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/earth-s-invisible-shield-can-help-reveal-our-past-and-our-future?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Earth’s invisible shield can help reveal our past and our future <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p><span class=\"bold\">I grew up obsessed with nature documentaries</span> – National Geographic, Steve Irwin, David Attenborough, Malcolm Douglas – I watched it all.
