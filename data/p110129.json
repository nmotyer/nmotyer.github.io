And we know that there are a lot of reasons why a child or young person might have developed this behaviour.</p><p>Some of our team are involved in a collaborative research program called the <a href=\"https://jss.org.au/programs/the-mens-project/early-interventions/\" target=\"_self\">Worried About Sex And Pornography Project</a> (WASAPP), an online early intervention for children and young people concerned about their sexual behaviours.</p><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/109763/varieties/375w.webp\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Education</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/q-amp-a-how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-misogyny-in-school?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Q&amp;A: How to talk to your kids about misogyny in school <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><p>WASAPP identified 10 pathways that can lead to the onset of 'harmful sexual behaviour' – many are <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15564886.2023.2208579\" target=\"_self\">driven by their own childhood trauma</a>.</p><p class=\"justify\">But there are others that appear to be driven by different factors, like the 'hypermasculinity' or 'pornography' pathways.</p><p class=\"justify\">Let’s look at hypermasculinity first. This involves a child living in an environment dominated by an ideology that privileges men and boys over women and girls and supports rigid gender stereotypes.</p><p class=\"justify\">If a child’s environment is saturated by this ideology, it can set them – usually an adolescent boy – on a path towards 'harmful sexual behaviour' onset. If that boy is then exposed to factors like 'having misogynistic fantasies' or 'feeling deeply rejected', then he can be pushed towards 'harmful sexual behaviour' more intensely.</p><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0009/110223/varieties/64w.webp 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0009/110223/varieties/160w.webp 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0009/110223/varieties/375w.webp 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0009/110223/varieties/768w.webp 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0009/110223/varieties/960w.webp 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0009/110223/varieties/1280w.webp 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0009/110223/varieties/1440w.webp 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0009/110223/varieties/1920w.webp 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0009/110223/Deepfake-3-ManPhoneMasculinity-Getty.webp\" alt=\"A young male looking at his phone amongst a group of other young people\"   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Adolescent boys influenced by ‘hypermasculinity’ may be susceptible to harmful sexual behaviour.

Mainstream pornography often depicts violence against women, <a href=\"https://assets.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wpuploads/2023/02/cc-a-lot-of-it-is-actually-just-abuse-young-people-and-pornography-updated.pdf\" target=\"_self\">setting boys up to see sexual violence as normal</a>.</p><p class=\"justify\">That boy may then encounter 'amplifiers', which may include living in a sexualised environment or having a father figure who validates pornography use. As a result, the boy’s risk of developing 'harmful sexual behaviour' increases.</p><p class=\"justify\">The onset can be triggered by the boy making a conscious or unconscious decision to act out the pornography on another child, or to seek out child sexual abuse material.</p><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/73385/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Health &amp; Medicine</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/three-things-schoolkids-need-to-succeed?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Three things schoolkids need to succeed <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><p>One 17-year-old boy who participated in WASAPP and accessed child sexual abuse material described his journey on the pornography pathway:</p><p class=\"justify\"><em>“I had way too much time and used that to get to places on the internet that made me feel like I was important or that I had a special skill or that I had a place there that I was respected at a certain part of the internet, just because I had the skills to get there.
