The work asks for you to enter your handle into an iPad, and then the algorithm lifts a randomised sample of your captions and inputs them into a personalised audio journey, which you listen to alone.</p><p>The audio recalls the tradition of the mourning poem – an elegy – in the sombre rooms where we lament what is lost. Scrape Elegy, is, in its physical form, a giant pink public toilet. It’s a place many will feel is a familiar spot for a sweet little doom scroll.</p><p>While Instagram is a platform for images, the work focuses on captions. Where captions are text, the work uses audio. Where Instagram posts are shared with an audience of online viewers, this work is private.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/82276/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Arts &amp; Culture</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/your-face-is-muted?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Your face is muted <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p>It draws from aspects of Claire Hopper’s <a href=\"https://www.booktopia.com.au/artificial-hells-claire-bishop/book/9781839767753.html?source=pla&gclid=Cj0KCQiAsdKbBhDHARIsANJ6-jdOFYfyzSqMGDdQabRjzbz5rVzz9Jtq_MA61bGokRP5_LBPy5LTWx0aAhohEALw_wcB\" target=\"_self\" class=\"italics\">Artificial Hells</a>, in which the performance of the work is delegated to the viewer.
