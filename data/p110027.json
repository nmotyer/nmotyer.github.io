We can think of the audit process as gradually collecting evidence that either supports the reported outcome, conflicts with it, or has no bearing.</p><p>Once we have enough supporting evidence, we can stop the audit and accept the outcome. Otherwise, the audit may escalate to a full, manual hand-count.</p><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/80582/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Sciences &amp; Technology</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/challenging-decisions-made-by-algorithm?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Challenging decisions made by algorithm <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><p>An RLA has several advantages over a traditional tabulation audit.
