But when I left high school, it was hard for me to decide between physics and fine art. I tried hard to find a combined degree, and I really wanted to do a degree in painting, but somehow, I ended up in a science program at the <a href=\"https://www.anu.edu.au/\" target=\"_self\">Australian National University</a> in Canberra.</p><p>By the end of my bachelor’s degree, I had had enough of pure science, and so I enrolled in a <a href=\"https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/graduate/master-of-cultural-materials-conservation/\" target=\"_self\">Master’s degree in painting conservation</a> at the University of Melbourne.

These dynamics could include how DNA repair factors arrive at a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956323/\" target=\"_self\">DNA double-strand break</a> to protect genome integrity and even how viruses hijack intracellular pathways to promote their replication.</p><p>In the long term, I hope that we can uncover fundamental insights into how the spatiotemporal organisation of the cell nucleus regulates genome function and DNA target search.
