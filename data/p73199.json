They find and discuss those clues amongst themselves: like,<a href=\"https://people.com/taylor-swift-reputation-taylors-version-album-outfit-easter-eggs-see-the-looks-8424632\" target=\"_self\"> do the recent snake motifs in accessories and green dresses mean we’re getting Reputation TV?</a></p><p>All of this is the type of work that a community manager usually does – engaging with the fan community and fostering a sense of belonging and connection is the hallmark of all communities.
