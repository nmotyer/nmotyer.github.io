Here are five simple answers to five basic questions to help demystify something that’s entirely normal.</p></span><span><h2 class=\"center\">Q. let’s start at the beginning – what’s the difference between perimenopause, menopause and postmenopause?</h2></span><span><p>Menopause refers to a women’s final menstrual period. Natural menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55 years old, which marks the end of your reproductive age. You are considered postmenopausal if you’ve had no period at all for 12 months.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/74331/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/74331/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/74331/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/74331/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/74331/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/74331/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/74331/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/74331/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/74331/444951d61ced6bc839b333b2913e71abe020bd69.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Around 32 per cent of women in Australia are currently experiencing symptoms they attribute to menopause.

It starts when menstrual cycles become very irregular (so the length of your cycle can vary by seven or more days in consecutive cycles) and continues until 12 months after you’ve had your final period. For some, perimenopause can begin five to 10 years before their final period.</p><p>But you can just use the term menopause as it’s divided into those three basic stages: perimenopause, menopause and postmenopause.</p><p>There are also other variables here – like <a href=\"https://www.onstella.com/the-latest/your-body/how-to-deal-with-induced-menopause-or-surgical-menopause/\" target=\"_self\">surgical or treatment-induced menopause</a>, <a href=\"https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/premature-and-early-menopause\" target=\"_self\">early menopause</a> (which can happen between the ages of 40 and 45) or <a href=\"https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/premature-and-early-menopause\" target=\"_self\">premature menopause</a> (which can occur under the age of 40).</p></span><span><h2 class=\"center\">Q. what’s actually happening to a woman’s body and why?</h2></span><span><p>Essentially, perimenopause, menopause and postmenopause are terms that all refer to the effect of declining circulating oestrogen (a group of hormones that play an important role in the normal sexual and reproductive development in women) in your body.</p><p>At birth, ovaries contain a certain number of cells (called follicles) which are involved in every menstrual cycle over a woman’s reproductive life.</p><p>As these follicles age and the number of follicles decline, there is a resulting impact on function and, consequently, circulating blood oestrogen levels drop.
