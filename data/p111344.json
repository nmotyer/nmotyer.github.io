In fact, many antibiotics that we use to kill bacteria originate from fungi.</p><p>The most famous example is penicillin which was originally <a href=\"https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/how-was-penicillin-developed\" target=\"_self\">found by accident</a> when a spore of the fungus <em>Penicillium</em> accidentally landed on a petri dish that had been seeded with bacteria in the microbiology laboratory of St Mary’s hospital in London.</p><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/109736/varieties/375w.webp\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Health &amp; Medicine</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/is-herd-immunity-in-intensive-care-doing-more-harm-than-good?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Is ‘herd immunity’ in intensive care doing more harm than good? <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><h2>Antibiotics cause imbalance</h2><p>Antibiotics will kill off certain types of bacteria, which can lead to an imbalance in our biome.</p><p>This imbalance can cause harm.
