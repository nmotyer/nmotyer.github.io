But as science comes up with better models of the links between fire, smoke, human health and our economy – we can use our flexible modelling framework to update these risk assessments.</p><p>All of this tells us that alternate risk mitigation strategies must be considered. We need to look at all the areas that are affected by the brutal reality of our changing climate through actions like planning, education, fuel breaks and suppression.</p><p>Ultimately, the threat of another <a href=\"https://eos.org/research-spotlights/australias-most-extreme-bushfire-season-statistically-speaking\" target=\"_self\">catastrophic bushfire season</a> in Australia is another urgent reminder of the need to cut our emissions deeply and quickly.</p><p><span class=\"italics\">The risk framework research team included Dr Hamish Clarke, Professor Trent Penman and Brett Cirulis, University of Melbourne; Nicolas Borchers-Arriagada, University of Tasmania; Professor Ross Bradstock, NSW Department of Planning and Environment; Michael Storey and Associate Professor Owen Price, University of Wollongong; Dr Mark Ooi, University of NSW; and Dr Kat Haynes, Natural Hazards Research Australia.</span></p><p>Banner: Getty Images</p></span></div>\n<p>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\">Pursuit</a>. <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/as-we-head-toward-summer-let-s-rethink-australia-s-bushfire-risk\">Read the original article.</a></p>","date_published":"2023-08-14T11:27:06+10:00","date_updated":"2023-08-14T11:27:06+10:00","url":"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/as-we-head-toward-summer-let-s-rethink-australia-s-bushfire-risk","title":"As we head toward summer, let’s rethink Australia’s bushfire risk","summary":"With wildfires and heavy smoke affecting the US and Europe, a new fire management framework can help Australia understand its risk","org_objects":[],"tag_objects":[],"author_objects":[{"name":"Dr Hamish Clarke","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/dr-hamish-clarke","orcid":"","fae_url":"https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/957141-hamish-clarke","email":""},{"name":"Professor Trent Penman","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/professor-trent-penman","orcid":"","fae_url":"http://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person669873","email":""},{"name":"Brett Cirulis","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/brett-cirulis","orcid":"","fae_url":"","email":""},{"name":"Nicol\\u00e1s Borchers Arriagada","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/nicolas-borchers-arriagada","orcid":"","fae_url":"","email":""},{"name":"Professor Ross Bradstock","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/professor-ross-bradstock","orcid":"","fae_url":"","email":""},{"name":"Michael Storey","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/michael-storey","orcid":"","fae_url":"","email":""},{"name":"Associate Professor Owen Price","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/associate-professor-owen-price","orcid":"","fae_url":"","email":""},{"name":"Dr Mark Ooi","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/dr-mark-ooi","orcid":"","fae_url":"","email":""},{"name":"Dr Kat Haynes","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/dr-kat-haynes","orcid":"","fae_url":"","email":""}],"citation_objects":[{"credentials":"Dr Hamish Clarke"},{"credentials":"Professor Trent Penman"},{"credentials":"Brett Cirulis"},{"credentials":"Nicol\\u00e1s Borchers Arriagada"},{"credentials":"Professor Ross Bradstock"},{"credentials":"Michael Storey"},{"credentials":"Associate Professor Owen Price"},{"credentials":"Dr Mark Ooi"},{"credentials":"Dr Kat Haynes"}]}
