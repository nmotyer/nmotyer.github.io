The good news is that based on our <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10596011211072951\" target=\"_self\">research</a>, ethics and creativity aren’t in a zero-sum game, instead they can complement each other.</p><p>We surveyed 327 employees working in 55 teams and their supervisors in a food service organisation head-quartered in Seoul, South Korea. This organisation considered creativity to be a key element of their operations, and their vision was “creating the most innovative poultry products to maintain industry leadership”.</p><p>In the surveys, each supervisor rated their teams’ creativity by evaluating the novelty and usefulness of the ideas developed by the teams. In addition, we asked the team members to evaluate the extent to which their supervisors demonstrated ethical leadership behaviours. The team members also reported their level of emotional attachment to the team, and their need for cognitive closure.</p><p>The results of our analysis showed that ethical leaders can boost team creativity by increasing team members’ emotional attachment to their groups.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/78411/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/78411/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/78411/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/78411/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/78411/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/78411/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/78411/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/78411/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/78411/Can-ethical-leaders-make-teams-more-creative_674f3109-a891-4f04-8e38-b920910c9294.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Research suggests that business leaders behaving ethically and in line with standards doesn’t smother creativity.

When team members have high levels of need for cognitive closure, they are motivated to find a solution to an ambiguous situation as quickly as possible, and they want to maintain the status quo once they find a solution.</p><p>In other words, these team members prefer making very quick decisions before investigating alternative solutions, and they don’t feel comfortable with the open-ended process of idea generation. As a result, their creativity suffers, because creativity requires exploring and being open to alternatives.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that when ethical leaders lead such teams, double negatives make a positive.
