Recycle everything you can</span></p><p>Boost your holiday spirit, save money and tread lightly on the planet by gifting preloved items.</p><p>Re-use wrapping paper from last year, regift untouched presents or gift old clothes and shoes you think others will love. Embrace vintage shopping and explore your local Facebook Marketplace for good quality preloved items.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">2. Embrace degrowth</span></p><p>The concept of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/02/are-young-people-poised-to-slam-the-brake-on-endless-economic-growth\" target=\"_self\">degrowth</a>, which advocates for buying less and consuming responsibly, can offer a fresh take on Christmas gifting. Perhaps you hand-make gifts for loved ones or decide to do away with present-giving altogether and focus on quality time with one another instead.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">3. Calculate cost-per-use</span></p><p>If you do decide to buy gifts, consider the <a href=\"https://calculator.academy/cost-per-wear-calculator/\" target=\"_self\">cost per use</a> rather than viewing the price as a one-off expense. Ethically and sustainably made products may appear pricier initially but will last longer, reducing landfill waste.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/73700/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/73700/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/73700/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/73700/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/73700/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/73700/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/73700/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/73700/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/73700/Have-yourself-a-very-thrifty-Christmas_2f92cf60-71f1-46fb-91a6-0424b6af8bea.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Recycled or handmade gifts can be great for both your wallet and the planet.

Rethink your nibbles</span></p><p>At Christmas, we often indulge in ultra-processed ‘nibbles’ like flavoured potato or corn chips. A cheaper, healthier and more environmentally friendly option is cutting some carrots or other vegetables into batons and serving with a homemade dip.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">2. Embrace in-season veggies</span></p><p>A healthy Christmas dinner is all about balance. Fill everyone’s plate with a wide variety of colourful vegetables or salads and then offer meat options (unless your meal is completely vegetarian).</p><p>Not only is this approach healthier and better for the environment, it’s also cheaper – especially when you buy seasonal fruit and veg from a local market.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">3. Consider frozen</span></p><p>If you are cooking roast turkey, it is often cheaper to buy frozen than fresh and it’s just as nutritious. Leftovers can also be turned into a delicious curry or risotto.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">4. Reduce eating and drinking time</span></p><p>People often eat and drink because there is nothing much else to do. If you include activities like a walk or game during the day can reduce the need to have endless nibbles and drinks available.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/73699/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/73699/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/73699/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/73699/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/73699/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/73699/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/73699/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/73699/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/73699/Have-yourself-a-very-thrifty-Christmas_b5bf28bb-8934-497e-a260-d1506cd1a3f5.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Seasonal fruit and vegetables are cheap, healthy and delicious.
