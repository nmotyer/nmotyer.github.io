Firstly, we need to acknowledge that something is amiss and identify a course of action. However, it may not be at all clear what to do – the situation is often bewildering, even impervious to objective appraisal.</p><p>The British author <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/mccrum-robert-1953\" target=\"_self\">Robert McCrum</a> describes in his memoir <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/645412\" target=\"_self\" class=\"italics\">My Year Off</a><span class=\"italics\"> </span>how, after suffering a major stroke, he found it difficult to think rationally about what he was undergoing:</p><p><span class=\"italics\">Sometimes it is difficult for me to acknowledge the importance of what has happened. I come from a tight-lipped culture in which the standard response to misfortune is to assert that one is ‘fine’, or that one is ‘perfectly OK’.</span></p><p><span class=\"italics\">It is, of course, a massive denial to claim that one is coping when plainly one is not. For me to admit that I was often scared and lonely these long winter months was as difficult as it was to admit that I could, sometimes, feel a profound anger towards the world that had done this to me.</span></p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/75071/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/75071/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/75071/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/75071/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/75071/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/75071/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/75071/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/75071/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/75071/Knowing-when-to-seek-help-for-mental-health-_49041431-c68b-4a86-bdfb-ab4ec361a933.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>If the problem is beyond our skills, systematic aid is usually required by an advocacy group.

This is best done through sharing the experience of the worrisome change with trusted others, usually family members or close friends.</p><p>They may be able to help in unravelling the nature of our difficulties, and through such collaboration deal effectively with them. If the problem is beyond our skills, systematic aid is usually required by an advocacy group like <a href=\"https://aa.org.au/\" target=\"_self\">Alcoholics Anonymous</a> (AA) or a walk-in facility (for example, in Australia, <a href=\"https://headspace.org.au/\" target=\"_self\">Headspace</a>).</p><p>Frustratingly, help-seeking can go wrong.
