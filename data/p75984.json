Also with mixed results.</p><p>Universities have a limited capacity to effect change on the ground in primary and secondary classrooms across Australia. However, universities can play a critical role in paving the way for more of us to consider further study a viable reality in the face of the pressing realities of paying the bills, fulfilling obligations to our family and kin, and dealing with the ever-present realities of our socioeconomic situations.
