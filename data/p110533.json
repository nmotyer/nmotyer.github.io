Rights of Nature must be relational and anti-colonial</h2><p>To be genuinely transformational, the rights of Nature must reflect the relationship we desire to create and maintain between people and place. In settler colonial societies like Australia, the laws of Indigenous Peoples must be centred and we must acknowledge their continued leadership in the rights of Nature movement.</p><p>Non-Indigenous advocates and the settler state need to work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples, while recognising that some Indigenous People <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13200968.2019.1802154\" target=\"_self\">reject</a> ‘rights’ framings and ‘legal personhood’ constructions of Nature.</p><p>In all societies, creating and implementing the rights of Nature must focus on articulating the why, and using this as a mechanism to re-connect people and place.</p><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/110536/varieties/64w.webp 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/110536/varieties/160w.webp 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/110536/varieties/375w.webp 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/110536/varieties/768w.webp 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/110536/varieties/960w.webp 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/110536/varieties/1280w.webp 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/110536/varieties/1440w.webp 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/110536/varieties/1920w.webp 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/110536/NatureRights2_WorkshopSydneyBarka_Erin-Matariki-Carr.webp\" alt=\"Group of people and one dog standing in front of an exhibition promotional wall decoration\"   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Experts gathered in Sydney for a workshop, and participants also visited ‘Barka: The Forgotten River’ exhibit at the Australia Museum.

Different jurisdictions will have different legal norms, cultural contexts, political institutions and histories. Moreover, each ecosystem is distinct, with different conditions needed for protection and regeneration.</p><p>Rights of Nature provisions will vary accordingly, from specific rights accorded to Nature as a whole (like in Ecuador), to legal personhood (Aotearoa New Zealand), living person (India) and living entity (Australia).</p><h2>3. Success will look different</h2><p>Success should be measured against the express purposes for which Nature’s rights were recognised. For example, in 2014 the <em><a href=\"https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2017/0007/latest/DLM6831573.html\" target=\"_self\">Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act</a></em> recognised the Whanganui River as a ‘legal person’, but the purpose wasn’t to deliver immediate environmental improvements but rather to contest colonialism and recognise the river’s relationship with Whanganui iwi (the people of that region).</p><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0020/81173/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Environment</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/australia-s-rivers-are-ancestral-beings?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Australia’s rivers are ancestral beings <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><h2>4. Success takes time</h2><p>Although creation of Nature’s rights can be relatively quick, it is very unlikely to have immediate on-ground outcomes. Gerrard Albert, lead negotiator for Whanganui iwi, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p080h12j/this-river-can-sue-you-in-a-court-of-law\" target=\"_self\">describes</a> long-term success as changing the future decision-making about the hydropower scheme that extracts water from the Whanganui River – in twenty years’ time.</p><h2>5. Standards enable accountability</h2><p>Until recently, a key obstacle to the enforcement of the rights of Nature has been a lack of standards for measuring compliance with, or violations of, these rights. However, this is now beginning to change.</p><p>In Ecuador, the Constitutional Court is establishing a line of jurisprudence that imposes a higher legal standard for rights of Nature than that of existing environmental protections. In the case of the <a href=\"https://ecojurisprudence.org/initiatives/rights-of-aquepi-river-case/\" target=\"_self\">Aquepi River</a>, the court held that the river has a right to flow, the first time that rights of Nature has included such a standard for riverine rights.</p><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/110537/varieties/64w.webp 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/110537/varieties/160w.webp 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/110537/varieties/375w.webp 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/110537/varieties/768w.webp 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/110537/varieties/960w.webp 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/110537/varieties/1280w.webp 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/110537/varieties/1440w.webp 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/110537/varieties/1920w.webp 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0017/110537/NatureRights3_EcuadorAmazonRainforestRiver_flikr-Norad.webp\" alt=\"High view of a wide river flowing through a rainforest\"   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Ecuador was the first country to recognise the rights of Nature in its constitution.

Rights are not enough: Nature needs institutions, organisations and funding</h2><p>Implementation of rights of Nature requires significant investment in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/three-rivers-are-now-legally-people-but-thats-just-the-start-of-looking-after-them-74983\" target=\"_self\">new institutional arrangements</a>, including adequately funded independent organisations.</p><p>In the case of Colombia’s Río Atrato, the current administrative structures and lack of funding are <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/news/earthbeat/colombias-choc-region-river-guardians-protect-rights-rio-atrato\" target=\"_self\">limiting implementation</a> of the river’s biocultural rights, a situation made worse by the lack of enforcement of existing environmental protections by the national government.</p><h2>7. We need to think seriously about liabilities</h2><p>As the climate crisis worsens; as we continue developing and building into Nature; and as we disregard the social construction of risk, we will experience the increasing harmful effects of extreme weather, ferocious wildfires, devastating drought and unprecedented floods.</p><p>Recognising Nature as a rights holder could give rise to <a href=\"https://www.globalwaterforum.org/2021/06/28/to-sue-or-not-to-sue-and-whom-that-is-the-question-confronting-indias-glaciers/\" target=\"_self\">liabilities</a> for any organisation created to act as Nature’s guardian or voice. Indeed, uncertainty about future liability has already led some appointed guardians in <a href=\"https://360info.org/rivers-are-still-people-in-south-asia-despite-court-showdown/\" target=\"_self\">India</a> to reject this role.</p><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/75250/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Politics &amp; Society</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-legacy-of-aqua-nullius-is-causing-a-sustainability-disaster?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>The legacy of aqua nullius is causing a sustainability disaster <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><h2>8. Changing language helps to change outcomes</h2><p>Recognising the rights of Nature requires a profound shift in our relationship to Nature, as we become partners and collaborators, bound together by mutual obligation.</p><p>For example, Te Urewera National Park in Aotearoa New Zealand, recognised as a legal person in 2014, now seeks to implement ‘<a href=\"https://www.ngaituhoe.iwi.nz/friendship-agreements-the-way\" target=\"_self\">friendship agreements</a>’ that require consideration for the wellbeing of Te Urewera herself, replacing the traditional concessions or permits for access to the National Park.</p><h2>9. Learn from other examples of legal personhood</h2><p>We don’t have to reinvent the wheel. We can learn from significant advancements in <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1743872119857068\" target=\"_self\">human rights</a> law, <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10383441.2021.2003742\" target=\"_self\">corporations</a> law and <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Rights-for-Robots-Artificial-Intelligence-Animal-and-Environmental-Law/Gellers/p/book/9780367642099\" target=\"_self\">artificial intelligence</a>. There are, for example, important parallels between advancements in rights of Nature and legal personhood for disabled people, like as the emerging concept of <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10383441.2021.2003744\" target=\"_self\">relational personhood</a>.</p><p>The legally binding international human rights instruments may provide useful examples for establishing the rights of Nature at a transnational scale.</p><h2>10.
