The discipline is really taking off now – the research base is growing and there are so many unanswered questions.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">After a period of dancing and teaching professionally around the world, another insightful mentor suggested I write a brand new masters degree in dance science. </span>She was brave enough to invest in me and my passions. I had completed a master of sport science, so I brought together sports scientists and dancers to help me write the new degree. We started with the masters, and now Trinity Laban offers a BSc, an MSc, and MFA and a PhD in dance science.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Dance science can help boost elite dancers’ capacities to push boundaries – just as sport science does for athletes.</span> Many leading dance companies have almost eradicated all chronic, long-lasting injuries as a result of proper healthcare and injury support.</p><p>We have <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/2013/09000/The_Effect_of_a_Comprehensive_Injury_Audit_Program.8.aspx\" target=\"_self\">evidence</a> to show that dancers are less injured and are enjoying longer careers. We know more about the ideal amount of daily practice, and the importance of incorporating adequate rest and recovery for optimising performance. Companies such as <a href=\"https://australianballet.com.au/\" target=\"_self\">The Australian Ballet</a> are leading the way in this area by integrating science into training regimens. None of this has happened historically in dance.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0035/78578/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0035/78578/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0035/78578/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0035/78578/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0035/78578/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0035/78578/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0035/78578/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0035/78578/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0035/78578/The-art-and-science-of-dance_79eaca81-6788-4c86-9ef9-5296785a2587.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Dance Science is a growing discipline extending from the physical fitness of dancers to how dance can promote wellbeing.

The VCA not only has a proven track record of training artists but also a steadfast commitment to diversity and inclusion. It’s not afraid to ask important questions and make permanent changes.

We still have a long way to go in the arts, and particularly in dance – many of my dance peers didn’t know that having children and retaining a career was an option. Seeing female role models is an important part of that change.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">The VCA also has amazing research scholarship.</span> There are so many staff who are practising researchers here. So many are well known in their field, and that really drew me here, too. A lot of my work has been cross-disciplinary, I’ve worked with anthropologists, medics, and psychologists, for example as well as a range of artists.</p><p>Being part of the University of Melbourne, with its amazing faculties and potential for collaboration, offers so many new avenues of research.
