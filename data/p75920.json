Surprisingly we found that the unmet need for eye care in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was the same in the cities as it was in the most remote areas.</p><p>The pathway of care – or the patient journey – was complicated. It was like a leaky pipe with many cracks and gaps where people would fall out of the system.
