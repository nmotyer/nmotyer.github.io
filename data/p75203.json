I chose to study STEM as I value the skills that it teaches. Critical thinking, analytical skills, adaptability and resilience are all important tools that allow us to thrive in an ever-changing world.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">My ultimate career aspiration has always been to work at a space agency</span>. All through high school, I aspired to be an astronaut. It was often considered a lofty goal, but my recent acceptance into an internship at NASA has brought me closer to my goals than ever before.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0027/80676/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Environment</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/cultivating-inclusive-research?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Cultivating inclusive research <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p><span class=\"bold\">I am among the first cohort of Indigenous Australian students to intern at the </span><a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_self\" class=\"bold\">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a><span class=\"bold\"> (JPL) in Pasadena, California.</span> The <a href=\"https://www.monash.edu/it/nisa\" target=\"_self\">National Indigenous Space Academy</a> (NISA) was set up by <a href=\"https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/chris-lawrence\" target=\"_self\">Professor Chris Lawrence</a> from Monash University’s Faculty of Information Technology.

As a part of the application process, I had to contact the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology at the University of Melbourne to get a letter of recommendation and confirmation of financial support. I am super grateful to have the support of the University of Melbourne with this internship and they have been incredibly helpful along the way. A few weeks later, a member from the <a href=\"https://origins-habitability.jpl.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_self\">Origins and Habitability Laboratory</a> at JPL reached out after viewing my application. We scheduled a meeting, and the onboarding process began from there.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">My intern research project is called </span><span class=\"bold italics\">Mineralogical Analysis of Compositional Gradients in Hydrothermal Chimneys</span><span class=\"italics\">.</span> This basically means researching life forms in the ocean as a way of understanding how life could form on other planetary bodies. It will involve research and laboratory work, drawing on my previous experience with mathematics, chemistry and data science from my undergraduate degree.</p></span><div data-component=\"VideoBlock\" ><div class=\"container\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"row\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"col-12\" data-v-4bbde884><figure class=\"ps-figure ps-figure--full-width\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"ps-embed-video__wrapper\" data-v-4bbde884><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LttD7fa1_aI?autoplay=1&amp;rel=0\" id=\"vidlink\" class=\"ps-embed-video__link\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"ps-embed-video\" style=\"max-width:845px;max-height:480px;\" data-v-4bbde884><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt style=\"background-image:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LttD7fa1_aI/maxresdefault.jpg?&amp;enablejsapi=1);max-width:845px;max-height:480px;\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"ps-embed-video__play-button\" data-v-4bbde884><svg id=\"playButtonSVG\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"   viewBox=\"0 0 128 128\" fill=\"none\"><rect id=\"playButtonRect\"   rx=\"64\" fill=\"black\"></rect><path id=\"playButtonPath\" d=\"M42.666 100.934V26.2676L101.333 63.6009L42.666 100.934ZM50.666 86.4009L86.5327 63.6009L50.666 40.8009V86.4009Z\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"ps-embed-video__video-title\" style=\"display:none;\" data-v-4bbde884><span class=\"ps-embed-video__title\" data-v-4bbde884></span><span class=\"ps-embed-video__duration\" data-v-4bbde884></span></div></div><div class=\"ps-embed-video__iframe-wrapper\" style=\"display:none;\" data-v-4bbde884><iframe class=\"\" src   frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen id=\"widget2\" title=\"Augmented Reality: Getting under the skin\" data-v-4bbde884></iframe></div></a></div><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-4bbde884>WATCH: Tully Mahr on being selected for a NASA internship by the National Indigenous Space Academy.
