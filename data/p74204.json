While it holds great value, so do Indigenous research methodologies – like yarning. Through the program, I’ve learnt how to identify these limitations and what to use, when. One of the great benefits of being in the professional certificate program, is to have Indigenous research and methodologies validated by colleagues, other students and supervisors.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/74208/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/74208/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/74208/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/74208/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/74208/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/74208/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/74208/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/74208/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0021/74208/Australia-needs-to-value-Indigenous-knowledge-in-medical-education_de5b66a6-2992-4445-9d53-cda4c679e275.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Dr Paul Saunders says there needs to be a generational change within the medical workforce.

I’m employing a convergent parallel research design, which means I’m applying both methods at the same time, bringing them together and triangulating the findings. I then interpret this through an Indigenous lens. My approach applies Western research methodologies, but it also applies an Indigenous perspective to interpret the data and the findings, an approach referred to as Indigenist research.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Indigenous leadership is a crucial part of the program. </span>After completing the Professional Certificate, I went on to study the <a href=\"https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/graduate/graduate-certificate-in-indigenous-research-and-leadership/\" target=\"_self\">Graduate Certificate in Indigenous Research and Leadership</a> which is more focused on what Indigenous leadership looks like within Western academies. The certificate explores Indigenous conceptualisations of leadership and research – how these qualities can be optimised and navigated within Western institutions.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Within an Indigenous context, leadership is not a hierarchical structure</span>. It’s community-informed and centred around a collective approach where there’s not just one leader but, rather, everyone has input into the way that leadership should look.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/82912/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Health &amp; Medicine</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-power-of-indigenous-data?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>The power of Indigenous data <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p><span class=\"bold\">The biggest difference between Western leadership and Indigenous leadership is that ours is a ground-up approach rather than the top-down one</span>.
