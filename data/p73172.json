It was during an evening lecture – everyone jumped up and ran outside onto the deck. In hindsight, it was a tiny little thing, but we were so excited to see it.</p><p>The atmosphere after we first landed was amazing. What stood out the most were all the different shades of white and blue and the incredible sounds: the wind, ice moving, penguin noises, snow flurries.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">When the group started talking about penguins and whales, my nutritionist brain switched on. </span>I am an animal scientist, specialising in animal nutrition and physiology. I work mostly with production animals and how feed impacts their physiology.</p><p>I do a fair bit of work on lactating animals. Dairy animals, for example, can be pregnant and lactating at the same time. It’s interesting to see how their cells take in nutrients and partition the energy. This research helps to improve feed efficiency.</p><p>Seeing humpback whales up close got me thinking about how these huge animals feed mainly on tiny Antarctic krill. They don’t eat while lactating, so humpbacks need to bulk up and store lots of fat before giving birth! It was also confronting knowing that krill populations are dwindling, and these animals are finding it more and more difficult to find food.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/73175/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/73175/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/73175/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/73175/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/73175/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/73175/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/73175/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/73175/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0023/73175/29a33228bead5bbe65177c18c49623fb492448af.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Research in dairy goats is 20 or 30 years behind where dairy cows are.

The money they make from milk can help put their children through school or get them out of poverty. I’m not directly involved in smaller farms yet, but I’m passionate about what the industry can do for women around the world, and I hope to play a part.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">I completed my bachelor degree in animal science, my honours, and my PhD at the University of Melbourne. </span>I had a great relationship with my animal physiology lecturer Professor Brian Leury. He encouraged me to pursue this path, and I’m so grateful.</p><p>My PhD looked at heat stress in production animals. One of the supplements I investigated is now used to help lower the body temperature of cows during summer and improve their productive output.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0015/74031/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Environment</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/human-rights-law-demands-climate-change-adaptation?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Human rights law demands climate change adaptation <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p><span class=\"bold\">I do a lot of collaborative research with commercial industries.</span> I’ve just started an <a href=\"https://www.arc.gov.au/\" target=\"_self\">Australian Research Council</a> (ARC) linkage grant in collaboration with <a href=\"https://meredithdairy.com/\" target=\"_self\">Meredith Dairy</a>.

Networks don’t have to be from the same discipline, either.

I connected with scientists from all over the world and I can’t wait to see what everyone does next.</p><p>I learnt a lot about myself, and the trip solidified that academia and teaching is where I want to be.
