Memory is particularly difficult to study in the laboratory because performance depends to a large extent on the lifetime of experiences people have before they enter.</p><p>German psychologist <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hermann-Ebbinghaus\" target=\"_self\">Hermann Ebbinghaus</a> (1859-1909) – the father of memory science – was well aware of the problem. In testing people’s memory, he needed something that would be unaffected by a person’s past experience and prior associations.</p><p>He came up with the idea of using nonsense syllables – like JOF and VEP – but it doesn’t really work. People are ingenious at turning nonsense syllables into acronyms or forming other associations.</p><p>These days, we use a range of stimuli – words, pictures, movie clips. These stimuli are more valid than nonsense syllables, but generalising from the laboratory to the real world is still very difficult. The laboratory is just too different from the circumstances of normal memory use.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/78375/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/78375/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/78375/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/78375/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/78375/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/78375/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/78375/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/78375/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/78375/How-big-data-is-unlocking-insights-into-psychology_f13ac4a1-ff11-448a-84be-cf8b356734c4.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>The large amounts of personal data we are now generating as we interact with technology, is a valuable new resource in better understanding us.
