I remember thinking, this isn’t for me. But then I discovered I could compose, and I loved that. It was so different from the pressure of getting out there and playing Beethoven, knowing it had to be perfect, and everybody else knowing when I’d made a mistake.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">I’ve always possessed a kind of blind faith. </span>I’ve experienced more highs than lows throughout my career, largely because I’ve chosen to overlook the setbacks. Rejection letters used to be challenging, but I adopted a strategy: I pursue five new opportunities for every rejection - this recalibrates my focus.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/75204/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Sciences &amp; Technology</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/taking-indigenous-australia-to-nasa?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Taking Indigenous Australia to NASA <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p><span class=\"bold\">I’ve developed a tough skin, which you need as a composer</span>. It can become overwhelming if you dwell on every setback, rejection, or imperfect rehearsal. Instead, I focus on moving forward, on to the next task.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">When I begin composing a new work, I first want to know what I’m writing it about</span>. I’m often inspired by what I’m reading or immersed in at any given time; that’s where I find the grain of sand in the oyster.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Starting the piece is always the most challenging part</span>. I’m not a composer that plans everything out beforehand. I’m very intuitive. Usually, around halfway through writing the piece, it feels like it’s just writing itself, and I’m along for the ride, which is both nice and scary.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">My latest composition is an orchestral work called </span><span class=\"bold italics\">Hun Tur</span><span class=\"bold\">. </span>It was written especially for the University of Melbourne Symphony Orchestra’s tour to Asia this September.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">The piece draws inspiration from my Hungarian ancestry and research into folk music</span>. This is reflected in the title with <span class=\"italics\">Hun </span>a reference to Hungary’s often misidentified early history (as having something to do with the Huns) and <span class=\"italics\">Tur </span>a reference to the Turul Bird, a creature central to Hungarian mythology.</p></span><div data-component=\"VideoBlock\" ><div class=\"container\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"row\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"col-12\" data-v-4bbde884><figure class=\"ps-figure ps-figure--full-width\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"ps-embed-video__wrapper\" data-v-4bbde884><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_nJ_3014f5g?autoplay=1&amp;rel=0\" id=\"vidlink\" class=\"ps-embed-video__link\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"ps-embed-video\" style=\"max-width:845px;max-height:480px;\" data-v-4bbde884><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt style=\"background-image:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nJ_3014f5g/maxresdefault.jpg?&amp;enablejsapi=1);max-width:845px;max-height:480px;\" data-v-4bbde884><div class=\"ps-embed-video__play-button\" data-v-4bbde884><svg id=\"playButtonSVG\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"   viewBox=\"0 0 128 128\" fill=\"none\"><rect id=\"playButtonRect\"   rx=\"64\" fill=\"black\"></rect><path id=\"playButtonPath\" d=\"M42.666 100.934V26.2676L101.333 63.6009L42.666 100.934ZM50.666 86.4009L86.5327 63.6009L50.666 40.8009V86.4009Z\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"ps-embed-video__video-title\" style=\"display:none;\" data-v-4bbde884><span class=\"ps-embed-video__title\" data-v-4bbde884></span><span class=\"ps-embed-video__duration\" data-v-4bbde884></span></div></div><div class=\"ps-embed-video__iframe-wrapper\" style=\"display:none;\" data-v-4bbde884><iframe class=\"\" src   frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen id=\"widget2\" title=\"Augmented Reality: Getting under the skin\" data-v-4bbde884></iframe></div></a></div><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-4bbde884>WATCH: Melody Eötvös - The Baron in the Trees 1.

Then, almost as if by osmosis, I was able to pick up the rhythmic tendencies, harmonic cells, and characteristics of this music. With this understanding and knowledge, I then wrote my own folk song.</p><p><span class=\"bold italics\">Hun Tur</span><span class=\"bold\"> has been designed around that folk song </span>and explores the implications of leaving certain parts of the harmony, melody, or rhythm out and then filling that space with variation and colour.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">I’ve dedicated the composition to my dad, who passed away last year</span>. He was always so elusive about his Hungarian heritage. Although he wanted to distance himself from it, this history is also a part of me.

The support I received through the Foundation was a significant moment for me. The opportunity to connect with other female composers and hear their experiences really highlighted to me some of the gender disparities that exist within the classical music world.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">High school is a critical point for young female musicians.</span> The statistics tend to show that for every female student entering undergraduate, masters, or doctoral programs, there are around four male students. I hope to encourage young female musicians in high schools to believe in themselves and to know they can have an incredible and viable career in music.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Music is powerful</span>. However, I prefer to let some parts of it remain an enigma for me still. When I’m writing a piece, it often ends up “writing itself”, so when I manage to create a moment in a work, whether it’s powerful or triggers emotions, I typically don’t go back and analyse how I did it.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/74807/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/74807/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/74807/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/74807/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/74807/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/74807/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/74807/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/74807/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/74807/Sharing-the-universal-language-of-music-_f490e0d2-3f06-49eb-a469-4bfd7b8db767.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Melody Eötvös’ latest composition called ‘Hun Tur’ was written especially for the University of Melbourne Symphony Orchestra’s tour to Asia this September.

I was in utero when my mum was learning the piano part for a performance, and I’d like to think that might have something to do with it.</p><p>There’s a moment in the first movement where this peak happens, and everything in the music has been gravitating towards that moment, and every single time it happens, I get goosebumps and a little tear. It’s so damn powerful. And still, to this day, if we played it right here and now, I would probably tear up.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">As a composer, I could analyse it and figure out how he did it and why it’s so powerful</span>. But, with this piece, I’m still on the fence about whether I want to do that because it might destroy the mystery.
