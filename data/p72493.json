In accordance with <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Nelson_Mandela_Rules-E-ebook.pdf\" target=\"_self\">international standards</a>, prison healthcare providers can take three important steps towards preventing these deaths.</p><p>First, they can routinely assess each person’s health status and comprehensively identify healthcare needs when they enter prison. Second, they can provide – free of charge and without discrimination on the grounds of legal status – a standard of healthcare at least equivalent to that available in the community.</p><p>Third, they can support a healthier transition back to the community by conducting a comprehensive pre-release needs assessment and coordinating transitional healthcare around the time of release.</p><p>Although correctional healthcare providers have a key role to play, reducing preventable deaths after incarceration will require a coordinated, whole-of-government response.
