A commonly cited reason is the urgency of addressing environmental issues, which is obvious with <a href=\"https://library.wmo.int/records/item/68835-state-of-the-global-climate-2023\" target=\"_self\">numerous floods and bushfires</a> affecting all parts of the globe.</p><p>Additionally, the effects of climate change, like greenhouse gas emissions, are easier to measure than social issues like poverty or wellbeing; and businesses have limited time and resources.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0032/73868/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Business &amp; Economics</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/getting-the-right-money-on-the-right-terms-at-cop28?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Getting the right money on the right terms at COP28 <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p>But as much as we may want this simplicity, people and planet are inextricably linked and it’s impossible to untangle climate-related and non-climate-related reforms.</p><p>For example, we cannot achieve the much-needed energy transition without people who have the right skills and are in the right place at the right time, or without thinking about who will have reliable and affordable access to energy. And we can’t mine for the critical minerals needed for electric vehicles without considering the degradation of people’s habitats.</p><p>We also need to ensure that different peoples’ perspectives are sought and listened to.
