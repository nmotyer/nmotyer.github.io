And some of the answers can feel quite human.</p><p>So how do these chatbots engage with us in human-like ways?</p><p>The technology underpinning chatbots has evolved since the 1960s. The seminal advancement was the invention of data-driven algorithms – otherwise known as <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3394399/machine-learning-algorithms-explained.html\" target=\"_self\">machine learning algorithms</a> or <a href=\"https://medium.com/mytake/artificial-intelligence-explained-in-simple-english-part-1-2-1b28c1f762cf\" target=\"_self\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). AI enables the kind of ‘conversations’ that LamDA has had with humans.</p><p>Chatbots are essentially computer programs that interpret written or spoken language and provide appropriate responses. Many programming languages and technologies can be used to build them. Regardless of approach, chatbots are of two basic types: ‘rules-based’ chatbots, like ELIZA, and ‘smart’ chatbots, like LaMDA.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0031/78718/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0031/78718/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0031/78718/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0031/78718/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0031/78718/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0031/78718/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0031/78718/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0031/78718/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0031/78718/Is-sentience-really-the-debate-to-have_d370fd15-fe80-4aa7-a0d7-50d1c5ae3a9e.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Chatbots are essentially computer programs that interpret written or spoken language.
