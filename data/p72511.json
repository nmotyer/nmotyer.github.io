Second, it could induce stress and cause whales to avoid certain areas (avoidance). And finally, noise could reduce the ability to identify their surroundings (confusion).</p><p>We can all relate to this: it’s harder to have a conversation at a loud concert than at the park (solitude); if someone is drilling outside your office window, you’ll probably be a bit stressed and would prefer to work from home (avoidance); and, if you’re trying to find someone based on where their voice is coming from, it becomes much harder if there are lots of other noises (confusion).</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0022/77062/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Environment</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-smallest-marine-microbes-share-nutrients-briefly?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>The smallest marine microbes share nutrients – briefly <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><h2 class=\"center\">The role of mathematics</h2></span><span><p>Obviously we can’t keep whales in a lab to test their noise sensitivity, so mathematical models are a useful way to test these ideas.</p><p>We build models by writing algorithms that capture our knowledge and assumptions about whale behaviour and the physics of sound transmission.
