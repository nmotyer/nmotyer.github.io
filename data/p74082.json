I spent so long just telling the story of what happened, that we never got into how to move forward. And it was just exhausting. I can roll it off my tongue and it just sounds like I’m making it up.</span></p><p><span class=\"italics\">You know, knowledge is power. But growing up, I didn’t know what to believe about the homicide. I always felt I was missing a part of the puzzle. I started asking questions. I got shut down. Everything was so taboo. I gathered all the information I could to form my own opinion.</span></p><p><span class=\"italics\">There came a point where I went, ‘My life is literally a true crime podcast’ but no one talks about it. Nope, I’M talking about it. I’m standing up for what I believe in. This was the extreme end of family violence. Like it or not, that’s what it was.</span></p></span><span><p><span class=\"italics\">How the hell do you compact years of trauma? It is hard to talk and relive it, it is still quite raw. But the more I talk about my life, I find it a lot easier. You know, I went through that trauma, but look at where I am now.</span></p><p><span class=\"italics\">How do I tell my story? As an empowering story. Mum’s memory lives on in sharing that story, helping others survive. I still worry what my family will think. But what if me talking helps another person? Then bugger them, the bigger picture is we’ve got to make a better future. But it’s always gonna be the hardest thing I’ll ever have to do.</span></p><p><span class=\"italics\">I’m 16… She’s never going to see me graduate. She’s never gonna see me pass my driving license. She’s never gonna be there when a boy breaks my heart.</span></p><p><span class=\"italics\">Now it’s been more than 20 years. One part of me is that story. I no longer need to tell the story to justify anything anymore But now my kids want to know why they never met grandma.</span></p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/74089/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/74089/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/74089/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/74089/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/74089/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/74089/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/74089/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/74089/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0028/74089/The-power-of-stories-to-rebel-against-a-taboo_9042b1f2-7148-4578-af5c-dfec6a32a385.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>The aim of narrative research is to understand how people create meaning in their lives.
