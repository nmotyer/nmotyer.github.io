This year, following heavy rains, there was lots of beautiful green ground cover with flowering cacti.

You don’t necessarily find a fossil every day, but it’s worth it for those moments of discovery. On this dig, a student and I took a steep climb to a spot, digging there for hours. But once we found that first fossil after cracking open a rock, it all became worth it.</p><p>We were then able to excavate a large portion of the site with our field crew. We found more than 50 fossil specimens at the site – even some that may represent new species. You just need to keep working tenaciously and hope for the best.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">The key to surviving a dig is camaraderie, a sense of adventure and plenty of optimism</span>. You need to have good colleagues around you for support. A strong sense of adventure creates the excitement, and you also need optimism to keep you going.

I instead carefully pack up my specimens and bring them back to the lab. I then gently crush up the rocks and add a series of quite dangerous chemicals that I’ve been trained to use to dissolve away the rock and isolate the pollen. I then use a microscope to see the tiny fossil pollen.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Pollen can tell us a huge amount about Earth’s history</span>. Everyone has smelt a flower, had hay fever or seen big yellow clouds of pollen dust.

The best thing about being a palaeontologist is going on these adventures, discovering new things and helping to understand the world around us.</p><p>I didn’t realise you could do this as a profession – how many palaeontologists do you meet on your day to day lives? But it’s possible and that’s what is exciting.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">You don’t have to travel overseas to find fossils</span>. Amateurs and interns can join a dig and you can be trained on the job. If you want to have a go yourself, you can use spades or shovels – things you can find in your shed. There are places in Victoria you can go and collect fossils. There’s Fossil Beach on the Mornington Peninsula and you can find fossils in the cliffs all along Bells Beach in Torquay.</p><p>– As told to Alexa Viani</p><p><span class=\"italics\">Want to learn more?
