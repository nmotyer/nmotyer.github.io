For example, in Australia, the field is intense, but around Brazil, the field is three times weaker: this is called the <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-is-tracking-a-huge-growing-anomaly-in-earths-magnetic-field\" target=\"_self\">South Atlantic Anomaly</a>. When the International Space Station or satellites pass through this region, they need to shut down their instruments or shield them to prevent electronic damage from cosmic radiation.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Global changes in the magnetic field are excellent chronology markers. </span>For example, around 41,000 years ago we had the <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/when-the-earth-s-magnetic-field-flipped\" target=\"_self\">Laschamp Event</a>. This was the most recent ‘geomagnetic excursion’: the Earth’s magnetic field became dramatically weaker, and the magnetic poles reversed, eventually migrating back.</p><p>By understanding this global event, we can identify its impact in the magnetic properties of a rock and say, “This is 41,000 years old.” Paleomagnetic techniques can help accurately date the things we find in sedimentary rock layers, like fossils or the remains of human activity.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/73856/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Environment</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-past-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-our-future-hotter-planet?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>The past gives us a glimpse of our future, hotter planet <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p><span class=\"bold\">I came to Australia to address the lack of paleomagnetic data from the Southern Hemisphere. </span>One of my career goals is to solve this long-standing problem and reconstruct the history of Earth’s magnetic field in Australia. I analyse multiple archives that preserve this information – a wide range of rocks and magnetic materials – to build up a comprehensive record.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">I recently started studying the magnetic properties of stalagmites. </span>Australia’s lack of active tectonic and glacial processes means our lakes are usually shallow and dry out periodically, which affects the preservation of magnetic information in sediments.</p><p>Stalagmites are a good alternative archive because they can give us detailed information about magnetic field changes over time, at a resolution typically higher than that of lake sediments. There are plenty of stalagmites in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst\" target=\"_self\">karst systems</a> around Australia. I focus on Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">I am developing a new method for dating rocks and artefacts at sites of human occupation. </span>Artefacts like bricks, ceramics, fireplaces and fire-treated stone tools have magnetic properties.
