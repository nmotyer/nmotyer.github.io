AI is a ‘black box’ in which mysterious things happen and because we see it as mysterious we tend to distrust and fear it. These fears of the unknown are understandable, but they have a significant downside. They can lead us to rely on human intelligence even when AI tools are superior to it.</p><p>Overcoming this source of resistance to AI is sometimes as simple as providing clear explanations for how it works.
