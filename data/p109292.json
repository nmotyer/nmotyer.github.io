As such, it is time to revisit common social values.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>     <strong>Speak out about time poverty, don’t shame others</strong></p><p>Demand change and defend others’ right to disconnect. Blaming and shaming others struggling to find adequate time resources as ‘poor time managers’ is a form of workplace bullying.</p><p>It is true that we all get the same amount of hours each day.

The nature of global online communication with its multiple channels and instantaneous real-time orientation invites digital messages – SMSs, notifications, posts – at all hours.</p><p>But is it clear how immediately a person is expected to respond? If not, make it explicit with a simple tagline to state no response is expected during private times.</p><p>Review your mobile communication including social media habits and behaviours. Commit to changing those habits that exploit social media/smartphones’ built-in time-intruding designs.</p><p><strong>4.    Model respectful, productive online discourse</strong></p><p>Similarly, don’t be a time waster. If approaching a sole trader, or a journalist, do you have a genuine request or inquiry?</p><p>Equally, is your online communication respectful, thoughtful, and constructive?</p><p>Every time the receiver gets a message ping, it takes time to respond, including review and delete. This is time the other person cannot use again.</p><p>Think before the approach and treat your recipient’s time with appropriate care.</p><p>The cyber time genie is out of the bottle, bringing myriad opportunities to connect with a world of others in new and meaningful ways.</p><p>It also carries moral responsibility to be fair with each other’s precious time, and our own, by economically and ethically using online technologies to protect finite time resources<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\">Pursuit</a>. <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/no-bandwidth-to-think-is-the-cost-of-being-time-poor\">Read the original article.</a></p>","date_published":"2024-06-04T19:42:18+10:00","date_updated":"2024-06-04T19:42:18+10:00","url":"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/no-bandwidth-to-think-is-the-cost-of-being-time-poor","title":"No bandwidth to think is the cost of being time poor","summary":"Cyber time poverty can affect all of us as distractions from social media, work messages and 24-hour news, but we can fight back","org_objects":[],"tag_objects":[],"author_objects":[{"name":"Dr Caroline James-Garrod","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/dr-caroline-james-garrod","orcid":"","fae_url":"https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1046544-caroline-james-garrod","email":""}],"citation_objects":[{"credentials":"Dr Caroline James-Garrod"}]}
