Sociological research shows men who enter professions stereotypical to women – like nursing or teaching – earn more money and are promoted more quickly.</p><p>This previous research suggests that men won’t take poorly paid, low-status, woman-dominated jobs. But, if they do step into them, they are likely to shift the cultures or reap greater status, power and money.</p><p>There’s reason to believe the COVID-19 pandemic will speed up the movement towards automation and artificial intelligence technologies.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/76908/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Arts &amp; Culture</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-modern-women-of-australian-ballet?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>The modern women of Australian ballet <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p>Major meatpacking plants in the US accelerated their movement towards robotics in their plants.
