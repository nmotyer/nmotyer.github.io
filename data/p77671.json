Aboriginal people lived in, cared for and managed the landscape of Buchan with fire (Phase 1). Settler farmers capitalise on the herbaceous grasslands created, cared for and managed by Aboriginal people and mimic Aboriginal burning practices (Phase 2). The Land Conservation Act (1970) prohibits fire. Flammable trees and shrubs drastically increase and the fire regime shifts from low-intensity fire to more catastrophic, high-impact bushfires (Phase 3).
