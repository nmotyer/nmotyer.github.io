A recent study found that more than <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1817561116\" target=\"_self\">40 per cent canopy cover is required just to negate the heating effects</a> of asphalt and concrete.</p><p>If planting trees is like installing natural air-conditioning, then laying asphalt is like doing star jumps while wearing a thick woolly jumper.</p><p>Currently the world is doing both.</p><p>We’re planting trees and building whole new suburbs with vast expanses of unshaded asphalt, plus black, heat-absorbing roofs on our houses. The development of apartment buildings follows a similar pattern: inner city areas might be becoming more pedestrian friendly and ‘buzzy’, but our streets are mostly car-oriented, which means we keep all the asphalt and concrete.</p><p>With tree planting efforts barely keeping pace with tree losses, we’re going to want to not only up our urban forestry budgets, but also look at the other side of the equation: all that asphalt.</p></span><span><h2 class=\"center\">Heat score by building</h2></span><div class=\"container ps-typography ps-display--flex ps-justify-content--center\" data-component=\"CodeBlock\"><html><head></head><body><div class=\"code\" style=\"max-width:48.25rem;width:100%;\"><div class=\"full-width\"><iframe title=\"Heat index of Melbourne\" aria-label=\"Map\" src=\"https://radiata.app.carto.com/map/fef4e2d5-caea-440b-aef7-ce514cba1bb6?zoom=8\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\"  data-external=\"1\"></iframe></div></div></body></html></div><span><p>Our latest Map of the Month focuses on this issue.

At the other end of the scale, if you’re lucky enough to be surrounded by trees and vegetation, you’ll see a lot of blue in your neighbourhood.</p><p>We also mapped neutral materials (grass and bare soil) and factored these into our scoring. Because we are looking at the impact of different kinds of open space around buildings, we haven’t included the heat impact of the buildings themselves, which can also add to the urban heat island effect.</p><p>The results are striking.</p><p>In total, we have surrounded our homes and workplaces with 271 square kilometres of asphalt and concrete, an area the size of central Paris and central Brussels put together.</p><p>More than half of all the buildings in Melbourne – over 1.5 million structures – are surrounded with land that’s at least a third concrete and asphalt.</p></span><div class=\"container ps-typography ps-display--flex ps-justify-content--center\" data-component=\"CodeBlock\"><html><head></head><body><div class=\"code\" style=\"max-width:48.25rem;width:100%;\"><div class=\"full-width\"><iframe title=\"Heat score by suburb\" aria-label=\"Map\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-BbExK\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BbExK/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\"  data-external=\"1\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></div></div></body></html></div><span><p>The distribution of these ‘sweltering streets’ is very uneven too.
