These asset management firms demonstrated how huge infrastructure projects require consistent maintenance and thorough risk management assessments to ensure they’re sustainable and safe.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/76188/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Sciences &amp; Technology</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/healing-wounds-with-differential-equations?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Healing wounds with differential equations <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p><span class=\"bold\">Most recently, I worked at </span><a href=\"https://www.nutromics.com/who-we-are\" target=\"_self\" class=\"bold\">Nutromics</a>, a medical start-up in Brunswick, helping me understand how challenging it is to take a medical device to market. Through the collection of these experiences, I have realised, first-hand, the power that engineering can have on the end users’ ability, lifestyle and health.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">The desire to have a human impact in my career was largely influenced by my parents.</span> Both my Mum and Dad are involved in media and documentary making, which demonstrates the value of storytelling in learning how to connect with people.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Dad always told me: “Whatever you end up doing – be it a lawyer, producer or engineer – help people.”</span> I’ve tried to use his storytelling skills in my academic and professional endeavour to help me express ideas, inspire people and positively influence others.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">A passion for human-centred design naturally steered me towards pursuing biomedical engineering projects.</span> So, it was a pivotal moment when I joined the <a href=\"https://www.alexexoskeleton.org/about-us\" target=\"_self\">Advanced Lower Extremity Exoskeleton</a> (ALEX Project) – a University of Melbourne-led initiative that aims to design a physical aid for paraplegia.

I also discovered the importance of work-life balance – I used to put so much emphasis on grades and I would only focus on academic accomplishments.
