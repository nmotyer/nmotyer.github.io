As she explains in the Netflix docuseries <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/au/title/81025735\" target=\"_self\">The Playbook</a>, Staley drew an analogy with when she was a player and nearly stopped after she missed a decisive shot.</p><p>To prevent her players from falling into the same trap, and to contain their negative emotions after defeat, Staley implemented a 24-hour rule she had imposed on herself: players have 24 hours to bask in their victory or agonise over defeat, but then they must move on.</p><p>An analogy can quickly uncover the most important factors for a decision and does not have to be imagined (as in simulation decisions) or inferred (as in metaphor decisions). A coach can build a stock of analogies by reading case studies or discussions with colleagues that would take a lifetime of experience to encounter.</p><p>A common pitfall is that people often don’t work hard enough to identify important differences between the analogy and the current situation.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/74496/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/74496/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/74496/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/74496/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/74496/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/74496/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/74496/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/74496/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0030/74496/Sports-coaches-make-these-seven-kinds-of-decisions_011c593f-7954-45de-9f54-be690e8fcf5b.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Head coach Dawn Staley of the South Carolina Gamecocks during the game against the Maryland Terrapins at Xfinity Center, November 2022 in College Park, Maryland.

He tells himself: “After four years of careful planning and brutal work, I have to let go. I have to trust our preparation and the character of the young men around me. I have cajoled and driven them, encouraged and even changed them. Right now, though, I can do little to control the test of courage they face.”</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0034/91699/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Health &amp; Medicine</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/unlocking-the-secret-to-changing-our-minds?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Unlocking the secret to changing our minds <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p>Stories are a very good fit with sports because sports involve a cast of characters with their various, and often conflicting, roles and objectives.</p><p>A story can select important factors for a decision, saving the coach time in having to understand every aspect of the situation.
