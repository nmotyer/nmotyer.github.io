In 2008 in China, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/10565838\">melamine was added to dairy milk</a> to artificially increase protein content. An estimated 300,000 babies became unwell from the contaminated products, and six deaths occurred due to kidney damage.\n</p>\n<p>\nCommon adulteration practices include the addition of <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341079441_A_novel_approach_to_detect_milk_adulteration_based_on_the_determination_of_protein_content_by_smartphone-based_digital_image_colorimetry\">water to milk</a>, or diluting premium wine and fruit juices with <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jaoac/article-abstract/65/6/1417/5702758?login=false\">lower-quality juice</a>, thereby increasing profits. Adding substances like <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-great-honey-wars\">cane sugar to honey</a> to produce ‘fake honey’ is also known as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fake-honey-problems-how-it-works-2020-9\">‘honey laundering’</a> which depresses the costs of real honey, impacting the livelihoods of beekeepers and deceiving consumers.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Tampering and mislabelling</strong> – Includes <a href=\"https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/labelling/dates\">changing expiry information</a> like the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-17/act-east-row-iga-fined-for-label-tampering-unsanitary-premises/102742384\">deliberate extension of use-by or expiry dates</a>. This practice poses health risks and has included an incident in China in 2015 where <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/06/24/china-smuggled-frozen-meat-40-years-old/29208679/\">40-year-old frozen meat</a> was smuggled into the country. Mislabelling includes the fraudulent description of a production method or origin, like fraudulently marketing produce as organic or free-range.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.9news.com.au/strawberry-needles\">2018 strawberry tampering incident</a> in Australia where strawberries were found to be inserted with sewing needles is a prime example of tampering.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Over-run</strong> – Where a product is made over production agreements or due to deliberate under-reporting of production. Problems arise when a fraudulent product is sold outside of regulated or controlled supply chains.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Theft</strong> – Where a legitimate product is stolen and enters the market as legitimately procured. While we do not have Australian data yet, <a href=\"https://foodfraudadvisors.com/underestimate_scope-of-food-fraud/#:~:text=Food and beverage thefts are,percent between 2022 and 2023\">recent reports</a> from the US indicate theft of food shipments increased by 600 per cent between 2022 and 2023. Stolen products are often sold alongside or co-mingled with legitimate products.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Diversion</strong> – Refers to the sale or distribution of legitimate products outside of intended markets. For example, in Yemen, it was found that donated UN food aid destined for needy people was instead <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/yemen-donated-un-food-aid-for-the-most-needy-sold-in-markets-to-boost-stallholders-profits-12841714\">being sold in street markets</a>.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Counterfeit</strong> – Occurs when aspects of the fraudulent product and packaging are fully replicated, often the most popular products. Honey is one of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fake-honey-problems-how-it-works-2020-9\">most ‘faked’ foods in the world</a>, with mislabelling of the country of origin and or adulteration with sugar syrup.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Simulation</strong> – Similar to counterfeit, but here illegitimate product ‘knock-offs’ mostly with lower quality or safety are designed to look like, but not exactly copy the legitimate products.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div></body></html></div><span></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/72947/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/72947/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/72947/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/72947/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/72947/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/72947/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/72947/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/72947/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0029/72947/35982b0ab353374a4f1a786ad7667d625b8af116.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Adulterated prawns, injected with different chemicals including jelly-like materials are a growing problem.
