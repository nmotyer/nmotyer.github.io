She also faces the disincentive that, as a tenant, she may have to reverse any changes she makes inside her flat if she moves out.</p><p>As a consequence, after her son has bathed, Hellene watches hot water disappear down the plug hole into London’s overburdened sewer system, before refilling the bath with more hot water for her teenager.</p><p>She is not on a metered supply so she does not pay for the extra bath water, but she says she finds it “depressing to see it go up and then down.”</p><p>The water for the bath in Hellene’s flat is heated in a boiler room which serves Hellene and her neighbours. The same system provides heating to radiators in each flat. The boiler runs on gas connected to London’s gas supply network, which in turn, is connected to pipelines that span Europe.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0026/75932/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Politics &amp; Society</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-future-of-our-public-housing-towers?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>The future of our public housing towers <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p>Hellene’s daughter’s very reasonable expectation of her own bathwater is easily accommodated by the water and energy networks that connect her flat to the estate, the estate to London, and London to rivers, groundwater and faraway gas fields.</p><p>And yet, when Hellene sees the water go up and down, she knows the changes in her household are having an impact somewhere else, and she feels bad about it.</p><p>Hellene sees the bathwater.
