Because everyone must eat, everyone has the capacity to transform conflict for good.</p><p>Appreciating the Lunar New Year’s potential for food peacebuilding does not mean romanticising an absence of conflict. Family feuds might still persist. Resentment might grow from the excessive planning and cooking required. ‘Open houses’, in reality, might be open in name only.</p><p>Nevertheless, Lunar New Year food practices hold great peacebuilding value. Reunion meals and open houses draw different people together.
