The most urgent need is for disaggregated data by Indigenous status<span class=\"italics\">, </span>including health, correction data, education and development.</p><p>Indigenous community leaders need data for decision-making purposes to enable their organisations to pursue the highest priorities based on evidence.</p><p>A critical point that needs to be understood by government officials and data custodians is that, as <a href=\"https://bby.org.au/\" target=\"_self\">Binarri-binyja yarawoo</a> Technical Advisor Christine Deng has put it, “data access and shared decision-making are two sides of the same coin”.</p><p>A key step forward would be initiating joint decision-making between government officials and community leaders by involving these voices in decisions over Commonwealth funding with the core goal of establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research Data Commons.</p><p><span class=\"italics\">The research highlighted here was presented at a two-day roundtable hosted at the University, which enabled vibrant, insightful and important discussions on the practical and technical application of Indigenous Data Governance and Sovereignty principles.
