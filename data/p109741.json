I found it difficult to sit still in the classroom, even for ten minutes.</p><p class=\"left\">In China, we studied maths from kindergarten, and it felt more natural to me than other subjects.

Maths was my favourite subject, and I tended to finish the problems quickly and then – like Wei – I’d distract other kids who were still working and get into trouble.</p><p class=\"left\">Because I was a nuisance in class, and I used to write fast and messily, the teachers assumed I was bad at maths. I had to slow down and write clearly, so they could see my answers were correct.</p><p class=\"left\"><strong>Wei :</strong> I used to be messy too, which led to mistakes in my calculations, so I started taking more care. From the fifth grade, my exam responses were like perfect printed pages.</p><p class=\"left\">My parents didn’t go to university so initially I didn’t consider studying beyond my bachelor’s degree. My father pushed me towards finance subjects, but I didn’t like them.</p><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0019/72802/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Sciences &amp; Technology</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/diverse-role-models-and-mentors-are-helping-women-in-stem-succeed?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Diverse role models and mentors are helping women in STEM succeed <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><p>Then I went to the USA on an exchange program and met some PhD students. Their work really interested me, so I started to think that a higher degree in research would be a good fit for me.</p><p class=\"left\"><strong>Astrid:</strong> I decided to study software engineering at the University of Technology Sydney. While I was there, I joined a group led by <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary-Anne_Williams\" target=\"_self\">Professor Mary-Anne Williams</a></span> that competed in the international <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"https://www.robocup.org/\" target=\"_self\">RoboCup</a></span> in Italy in 2004.</p><p class=\"left\">We programmed a soccer team of four-legged robots that was only beaten by Germany in the final. I worked on the robots’ locomotion system – how they moved and processed sensory information to make movement decisions in real time – which was fascinating.</p><p class=\"left\">I subsequently worked on artificial intelligence (AI) at the <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/\" target=\"_self\">CSIRO</a></span> for four years, with a focus on biomimicry: we created algorithms for AI based on how humans process information. This inspired me to study human cognition and AI for my PhD.</p><p class=\"left\"><strong>Wei:</strong> I studied non-parametric statistics for my masters degree at the <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html\" target=\"_self\">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a></span> and my PhD at the University of Melbourne. Non-parametric statistics employs analytical models to find patterns or relationships in experimental or real-world data.</p><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/109744/varieties/64w.webp 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/109744/varieties/160w.webp 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/109744/varieties/375w.webp 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/109744/varieties/768w.webp 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/109744/varieties/960w.webp 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/109744/varieties/1280w.webp 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/109744/varieties/1440w.webp 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/109744/varieties/1920w.webp 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/109744/Mathematicians-moved-by-dance-karate-and-building-a-better-world2.webp\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Dr Wei Huang mixes martial arts with non-parametric statistics. Picture: Supplied</figcaption></figure></div><p>After obtaining my PhD, I started using more sophisticated statistical methods that determine causal relationships and eliminate confounding factors.</p><p class=\"left\">For example, we can observe that drinking alcohol is highly correlated with lung cancer, but it’s a confounding factor and not the cause. People who drink more alcohol also tend to smoke more tobacco, and causal inference analysis can demonstrate that smoking – not alcohol – is a causal factor for lung cancer.</p><p class=\"left\">I want to improve our methods so we can find complicated causal relationships in medical, educational or behavioural data, that then inform decisions and policies to boost our safety, wellbeing, social harmony and resilience.</p><p class=\"left\"><strong>Astrid:</strong> My current research focus is how we make sense of the world through our vision. How do our brains interpret the information we receive when we open our eyes, and what can shape or bias our interpretation?</p><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0025/75166/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Sciences &amp; Technology</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/actress-ballerina-engineer?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Actress, ballerina... engineer? <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><p>I’m currently running an experiment exploring how humans react when they see robots moving and whether they find their movements realistic or unsettling.</p><p class=\"left\">My larger objective is to help build AI systems that can assist humans to interpret images – for example, to improve the accuracy of a medical diagnosis – or that can perform tasks more safely than humans, like driving a vehicle autonomously.</p><p class=\"left\"><strong>Wei:</strong> Maths is still a male-dominated domain. To solve big problems in any field, it’s important to have a wide range of people from diverse backgrounds, with different ways of thinking. I’ve been lucky to work with some inspiring women, including my PhD supervisor <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/154426-aurore-delaigle\" target=\"_self\">Professor Aurore Delaigle</a></span>, who has given me great support.</p><p class=\"left\">I try to pay it forward.

She embodied work-life balance, having a loving family and a successful career, which made me feel that being an academic was feasible.</p><p class=\"left\"><strong>Wei:</strong> I love my job, I love the flexible way I can work, and I love martial arts. I train four or five times a week in Chinese Wushu and Karate.</p><p class=\"left\">I have always found it easy to learn movement sequences. It’s like finding graphical patterns. I’m inspired by movies that feature martial arts and I enjoy the romance and performance of martial arts.</p><p class=\"left\"><strong>Astrid: </strong>After spending my day working in front of a computer screen, it feels great to step away and move my body. I have spent a lot of time studying robotic movement systems, so there’s obvious overlap between my work and my recreational activities.</p><p class=\"left\">Coincidentally, martial arts – particularly, Japanese Aikido – inspire my dancing, and dancing inspires and informs my research as well as promoting my physical and mental wellbeing.</p><p class=\"left\">- As told to Rebecca Colless</p><p class=\"left\"><span class=\"underline\"><em><a href=\"https://may12.womeninmaths.org/\" target=\"_self\">Women in Mathematics Day</a></em></span><em> is celebrated annually and globally on 12 May, to honour the birthday of </em><span class=\"underline\"><em><a href=\"https://may12.womeninmaths.org/why\" target=\"_self\">Maryam Mirzakhani</a></em></span><em>.</em></p><p class=\"left\"><em>Learn more about </em><span class=\"underline\"><em><a href=\"https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/engage/women-in-maths-stats\" target=\"_self\">women in mathematics at the University of Melbourne</a></em></span><em>.</em></p><p class=\"left\">Banner: Supplied</p>\n<p>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\">Pursuit</a>. <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/mathematicians-moved-by-dance-karate-and-building-a-better-world\">Read the original article.</a></p>","date_published":"2024-05-10T00:00:00+10:00","date_updated":"2024-05-10T00:00:00+10:00","url":"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/mathematicians-moved-by-dance-karate-and-building-a-better-world","title":"Mathematicians moved by dance, karate and building a better world","summary":"To mark Women in Mathematics Day, two early career mathematicians – Dr Wei Huang and Dr Astrid Zeman – share their inspirations, achievements, ambitions and hobbies","org_objects":[],"tag_objects":[],"author_objects":[{"name":"Dr Astrid Zeman","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/dr-astrid-zeman","orcid":"","fae_url":"https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/783387-astrid-zeman","email":""},{"name":"Dr Wei Huang","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/dr-wei-huang","orcid":"","fae_url":"https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/799353-wei-huang","email":""}],"citation_objects":[{"credentials":"Dr Astrid Zeman"},{"credentials":"Dr Wei Huang"}]}
