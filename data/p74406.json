They have chosen to ignore <span class=\"italics\">Twelve Girls in the Garden</span>, <span class=\"italics\">The Saracen Shadow</span>, <span class=\"italics\">The Man Made of Tin</span>, <span class=\"italics\">The Myth is Murder</span>, and <span class=\"italics\">A Wake for Mourning</span> because he once described them as “pot-boilers” and wrote them under the name Shane Martin.</p><p>But, hopefully, not anymore. At the very least, George Johnston’s five Professor Challis novels are worth a second thrilling look.</p><p><span class=\"italics\">Dr Derham Groves’ new book </span><a href=\"https://hogpress.com/groves-homicide-on-hydra-george-johnstons-crime-novels/\" target=\"_self\">Homicide On Hydra: George Johnston’s Crime Novels</a>,<span class=\"italics\">published by </span><a href=\"https://hogpress.com/\" target=\"_self\">Hog Press</a>, <span class=\"italics\">is</span> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Homicide-Hydra-George-Johnstons-Novels/dp/B0CLG28264/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1698366935&refinements=p_27:Derham+Groves&s=books&sr=1-1\" target=\"_self\" class=\"italics\">available online </a><span class=\"italics\">and in good book shops.</span></p><p>Banner: George Johnston and Charmian Clift in Hydra, Greece by James Burke/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock</p></span></div>\n<p>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\">Pursuit</a>. <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/homicide-on-hydra\">Read the original article.</a></p>","date_published":"2023-10-27T12:11:35+11:00","date_updated":"2023-10-27T12:11:35+11:00","url":"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/homicide-on-hydra","title":"Homicide on Hydra","summary":"A new book explores the more-or-less forgotten crime novels of one of Australia’s most successful authors, George Johnston","org_objects":[],"tag_objects":[],"author_objects":[{"name":"Dr Derham Groves","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/dr-derham-groves","orcid":"","fae_url":"https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/4559-derham-groves","email":""}],"citation_objects":[{"credentials":"Dr Derham Groves"}]}
