The reliance on technology for documentation clashed with the essence of tradition, along with the concern surrounding where the recordings would go.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Younger generations prefer a hybrid learning approach</span>. I would watch them sit with Elders to hear, sing and learn, then later they would strengthen their learning by listening to MP3s of songs, carrying that around with them throughout the day.
