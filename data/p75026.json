Beginning with <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/d/dada\" target=\"_self\">Dada</a> and developing in earnest since the Protest Era of the 1960s and ’70s, artists and curators have been sceptical of the presumed objectivity and neutrality of the ‘<a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/w/white-cube\" target=\"_self\">white cube</a>’ gallery space.</p></span><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0033/78576/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Arts &amp; Culture</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-art-and-science-of-dance?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>The art and science of dance <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><span><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/situationist-international\" target=\"_self\">Situationist International</a>, was in turn influenced by early twentieth-century avant-garde art movements, which were intent on dismantling ‘spectacular’ mediations of social relations through objects.</p><p>It is also apparent that unprecedented social, political and technological circumstances currently unfolding – from deepening partisanship and reckonings centred on race, gender and power to algorithmic web-based distribution and AI – have created new opportunities and challenges for artists.</p><p>Most of the artworks and artistic research projects hosted by Project Anywhere were never intended for primary display within traditional exhibition spaces and programming schedules. So, we asked, how might artists better represent and disseminate such work? And, by extension, how should art of this kind be evaluated?</p><p>Since its conception in 2012, Project Anywhere has provided artists with peer validation, detailed expert feedback from a diverse range of established artists and scholars, community support, and global dissemination of their work.</p></span><div class=\"container\" data-v-012796f8><figure class=\"ps-figure\" data-v-012796f8><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"ps-figure__image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/75031/varieties/64w.jpg 64w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/75031/varieties/160w.jpg 160w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/75031/varieties/375w.jpg 375w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/75031/varieties/768w.jpg 768w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/75031/varieties/960w.jpg 960w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/75031/varieties/1280w.jpg 1280w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/75031/varieties/1440w.jpg 1440w,https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/75031/varieties/1920w.jpg 1920w\" src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0016/75031/Art-can-be-anywhere_4c74a9c3-cf63-4d8a-bba0-a8fbf29a4ede.jpg\" alt   data-v-012796f8><figcaption class=\"ps-figure__caption\" data-v-012796f8>Projects are typically highly speculative or discursive in nature.

A robust and exhaustive approach, in which the function of the curator is substituted for a democratising double-blind peer evaluation system – neither the artist nor the assessor knows the other’s identity – that effectively bypasses the currency of artistic reputation or exhibition track record as criteria for assessment.</p><p>Projects are typically highly speculative or discursive in nature and seek to extend or contradict existing methods and methodologies.
