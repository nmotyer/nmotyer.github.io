It’s caused by the foot-and-mouth disease virus – FMDV. This is a highly infectious virus that’s hardy in the environment.</p><p>While the disease is unpleasant, causing blisters on the tongue, around the mouth and on the hoofs, and affects livestock productivity, mortality is relatively low in adult animals.</p><p>The disease is a challenge from an animal health, animal welfare and food productivity point of view, but the economic consequences are also a major concern.
