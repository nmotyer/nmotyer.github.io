Will the value that is delivered be superior to existing offerings or solutions in the marketplace, such that customers will consider switching? Or if it is a process innovation, will any extra cost lead to net benefits?</p></li><li><p><strong>The market and marketing test.</strong></p><p>Will the innovation appeal to customers and can we find an effective channel to distribute our product to the marketplace?</p></li><li><p><strong>The operations and scale up test.</strong></p><p>Can the product or service being developed be effectively mass produced? It is not good enough to just rely on a pilot or prototype – the new innovation’s design must be sufficiently robust that it can be mass produced without compromising quality or productivity.</p></li><li><p><strong>The management and key personnel test.</strong></p><p>Do we have or can we recruit the human resources required to scale up and commercialise this innovation?</p></li><li><p><strong>The financial test.</strong></p><p>Will this innovation, whether it’s a product, service, new process, new technology or even a new business model, provide a financial return on our investment? Any calculations need to be adjusted to take into account the project risk.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intellectual property control and access test.</strong></p><p>Do we have full control of all intellectual property to be used in this innovation, or are we transgressing on the intellectual property of others? An intellectual property strategy is crucial when developing your innovation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategic alignment test.</strong></p><p>To what extent does the innovation fit and align with our organisational strategy and its priorities? Does this new product or service fit within or sensibly extend our existing portfolio of marketplace offerings and do we have the capabilities to produce, market, sell and distribute it, or to effectively outsource those activities?</p></li><li><p><strong>Sustainable development and ESG.</strong></p><p>Does this innovation at least meet minimum – and ideally much higher – standards of environmental and social sustainability? Will the innovation be attractive to consumers who are increasingly mindful of environmental and social factors when choosing products and services?</p></li></ol><!--[--><!--noindex--><article class=\"ps-cta container\" data-component=\"CallToAction\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__flex\" data-v-1d83364b><div data-v-1d83364b><img src=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/image/0018/72702/varieties/375w.jpg\" data-v-1d83364b></div></div><div class=\"ps-cta__info\" data-v-1d83364b><div class=\"ps-cta__top\" data-v-1d83364b><p class=\"ps-cta__channel ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-text-uppercase\" data-v-1d83364b>Business &amp; Economics</p></div><a class=\"ps-cta__link ps-ff-source-sans-pro ps-fw-semibold ps-lh-120 ps-cta__black\" href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/three-ways-to-avoid-mega-projects-going-way-over-budget?in_c=in_article_cta\" target=\"_self\" data-v-1d83364b><p data-v-1d83364b>Three ways to avoid mega projects going way over budget <i class=\"ps-icon--arrow-right ps-cta__black\" data-v-1d83364b></i></p></a></div></article><!--endnoindex--><!--]--><p>Using this sort of structured approach across a range of potential innovation projects can be an effective screening process that leads to a shortlisted set of projects that can be assembled into an innovation portfolio of activities. </p><p>Good businesses already use many of these tests when developing new products, and good Governments should also use test criteria like these. </p><p>The worst thing a government can do is simply wait and expect an efficient market to work: good governments and good business leaders are proactive and sensibly tilt the playing field to their advantage. </p><p>At all levels (government, big business, startups), good judgement, channelled through a strategic framework and set of structured criteria and tests, is the best way forward.</p>\n<p>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\">Pursuit</a>. <a href=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/these-eight-tests-will-help-you-decide-which-of-your-innovation-idea-is-going-to-be-a-winner\">Read the original article.</a></p>","date_published":"2024-06-13T15:55:18+10:00","date_updated":"2024-06-13T15:55:18+10:00","url":"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/these-eight-tests-will-help-you-decide-which-of-your-innovation-idea-is-going-to-be-a-winner","title":"These eight tests will help you decide which of your innovation ideas is going to be a winner","summary":"Effectively testing new ideas requires a systematic and structured approach from evaluation through to release","org_objects":[],"tag_objects":[],"author_objects":[{"name":"Professor Danny Samson","url":"https:\\/\\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\\/individuals\\/professor-danny-samson","orcid":"","fae_url":"http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person12950","email":""}],"citation_objects":[{"credentials":"Professor Danny Samson"}]}
