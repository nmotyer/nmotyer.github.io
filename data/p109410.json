The Richard Berry Building was named in 1970 – long after Berry had left the University – but other buildings have been named more recently and are now, rightly, challenged.</p><p class=\"left\">The naming of buildings after great men was a way of celebrating the University’s history. However, our work is showing just how much of this story is incomplete.
